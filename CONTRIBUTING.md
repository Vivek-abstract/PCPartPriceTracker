## Contributing to this project

Thank you for considering to contribute towards PCPartPriceTracker! I'm looking for PR's that can fix the issues listed [here](https://github.com/Vivek-abstract/PCPartPriceTracker/issues)

## Prerequisite
You need to have a decent understanding of C# and WPF framework to understand the project. I have used the MVVM architecture pattern to structure the project into 3 subprojects Models, Views (PCPartPriceTracker) and ViewModels. You can learn more about it here: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mvvm/index.htm

If you have any suggestions that can improve this project even further, ideas are welcome in the PR section! ðŸ˜„
